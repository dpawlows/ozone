Eleonor's Ozone Model is a 1D photochemical model that solves for
the production and loss of ozone in an atmosphere.  The goal of this
model is to determine if it is possible to create an ozone layer
in exoplanetary atmospheres.  In order to accomplish this, EOM
relies on photodissociation cross sections and irradiance values
that are supplied by the user.  Currently, EOM uses a small set
of chemical equations that are necessary to produce an ozone layer
at Earth under current atmospheric (T and P) conditions.
