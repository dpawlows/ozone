=======
Getting Started
=======
To install the code, execute::

  >>install.sh

at the prompt.  This will create a few files, including
eom.py.

========
Usage
========

Running the code is as simple as invoking python to run eom.py.
However, it is probably necessary to modify the input files to suit
the needs of the user. These files are located in the **input**
directory are are titled:

input???.inp

EOM is capable of reading multiple input files to complete an
ensemble of simulations.

See :doc:`inputs` for specific input options and descriptions.
